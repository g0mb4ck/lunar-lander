# Lunar Lander

## My research on NRF52810 was conducted in a partially automated way. The code I used to trigger the vulnerability is listed in triggerless_glitch/glitch_cs_triggerless.py in this repository.

This repo is meant to be a collection of useful pieces of code or small projects used in my research. As an open source spirit, I would like to share with everyone my little lines of code that hopefully will be useful to others.

I hope someday people will be happy to share their pieces of code here and contribute altogether to the moon landing :)

## Thanks

Huge thanks to Federico Cerutti (aka @ceres-c) for his help on glitcher-threaded.py
